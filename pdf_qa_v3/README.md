# DeepSeek-R1 PDF Q&A Assistant

## Overview
The **DeepSeek-R1 PDF Q&A Assistant** is a Streamlit-based web application that enables users to either upload a PDF document or search for academic papers by title, and then ask questions about their content. The application uses **DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B)**, an advanced language model, along with **HuggingFace embeddings** to index and retrieve relevant sections of the PDF for accurate responses.

  - Similar paper suggestions when exact match isn't found
  - Automatic paper download from supported sources
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Q&A**: Answers user queries based on the document content using DeepSeek-R1
- üìä **Efficient Retrieval**: Uses **vector search** to find relevant sections of the document
- üìú **PDF Preview**: Displays the document for reference
- üéõ **Reset Chat**: Clear previous interactions for a fresh start
- ‚ö° **Fast Response Generation**: Uses **streaming responses** for real-time answers
